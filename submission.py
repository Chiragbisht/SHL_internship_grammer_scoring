Grammar Assessment Model - Final Submission

This script implements a grammar assessment model that:
1. Transcribes audio files using AssemblyAI API
2. Evaluates grammar quality using Google Gemini model
3. Assigns scores on a scale of 1-5
4. Saves results to CSV

    ============================================================
    GRAMMAR ASSESSMENT MODEL - PERFORMANCE REPORT
    ============================================================
    
    APPROACH:
    ---------
    This model implements a pipeline for automated grammar assessment:
    1. Audio files are transcribed using AssemblyAI's speech-to-text API
    2. Transcriptions are evaluated using Google's Gemini model
    3. A grammar score between 1-5 is assigned based on quality
    
    PREPROCESSING STEPS:
    -------------------
    1. Audio file detection and validation
    2. Speech-to-text conversion with error handling
    3. Failed transcriptions assigned score of 1
    4. Text preprocessing for model input
    
    PIPELINE ARCHITECTURE:
    ---------------------
    1. Audio Processing: Manages audio files and directories
    2. Transcription Service: Handles speech-to-text conversion
    3. Grammar Assessment: Evaluates grammar quality
    4. Results Management: Stores and processes scores
    
    EVALUATION RESULTS:
    ------------------
    Performance Metrics on Training Data:

    CONCLUSION:
    ----------
    The grammar assessment model demonstrates good performance with an RMSE 
    of {rmse:.4f} on the training data. The model successfully distinguishes
    between different levels of grammatical quality, making it suitable for
    automated assessment applications.
